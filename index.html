        <h1>Osman Can</h1>
        <p><em>QHSE Manager - <strong>Lean Six Sigma Black Belt</strong> </em></p>
        <p> I am a geophysical engineer graduated from Engineering Faculty of Dokuz Eylül University, Turkey. I have attended courses on Gravity-Magnetic, Well-logging, Geographical Information System (GIS) and Seismic Reflection Methods, theory and
          practical applications of seismic data processing, potential field of hydrocarbons and trap stiles.
          In spite of having a geophysical engineering degree and a background on Geophysics, I developed my professional career on the Quality, Health and Safety area of the oil and gas industry, upstream sector. I got my <strong>MSc Degree on
            Occupational Health
            and Safety</strong> from Yeni Yuzyil University, Istanbul. During my Masters’ I had courses such as Risk Assessment, Work Psychology, Industrial Hygiene, Work Sociology (Unions and Social Strategies), Work Accidents and Safety, Assessment
          of Safety
          Statistics, Occupational Diseases, Safety Legislation, Ergonomics, Emergency Preparedness etc. I also got <strong>NEBOSH International General Certificate (awarded with Distinction</strong>) and completed other various trainings listed in
          the Training &
          Certificates section. Additionally I have attended to the Project Management Training and have a systematic approach on planning and organizing. I am an <strong>ISO 9001:2015 Lead Auditor</strong> and <strong>Lean 6 Sigma Black
            Belt</strong>.
          My QHSE experiences have expanded with an Integrated Oil Field knowledge including Drilling, Completion and Geophysical Services by a fast track program. During the course of my work, I found opportunities to implement what I have learnt
          from the
          trainings, which are included in the Achievements section of the work experiences.
